This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information collected and recorded by My Zetamac Score and how we use it. This policy applies only to the Extension and is valid for users who choose to use it.

## Information Collection and Use

The Extension does not collect any personal information from its users.
The only permission required by the Extension is for storage:

### Storage Permission:
The Extension requests access to local storage on your device to save and retrieve game scores.
This data is strictly limited to the game score data shown on the screen at the end of each round under the default mode and the date.
No personal or sensitive user data is accessed, stored, or transmitted.

## Data Storage and Protection

Local Storage: All data collected by the Extension is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any servers or third parties.
This means your data remains under your control and is not accessible to the developers of the Extension or any external entities.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data collected by the Extension, as all data remains on your local device.
The Extension does not transmit data externally nor does it allow access to the data by third parties.

## Your Data Rights

Since the Extension stores data locally on your device, you have full control over this information.
You can view, modify, or delete your saved data at any time by accessing the local storage used by the Extension.
